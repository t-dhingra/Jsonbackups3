These fluctuations profoundly influence the interactions between the catalyst and the gas and liquid phase, thereby influencing the surface and bulk structure and properties of the catalytic material. It is thus paramount to grasp this intricate interplay to facilitate a knowledge-driven exploration of novel catalytic materials, pinpointing structural features directly pertinent to catalytic activity while pushing the boundaries of time and spatial resolutions.",

Wildland fires are one of the largest sources of pollutants to the global atmosphere with serious impacts on air quality, air chemistry and climate.  Wildland fires also result in significant environmental impacts including habitat destruction, wildlife and biodiversity impacts, water quality decline and human and environmental health impacts.  \nNearly half a century of wildland fire emissions research exists.  However, due to the complex emissions chemistry of wildland fires key data gaps remain.  With climate change increasingly driving higher fire activity, the need to understand the full environmental and health impacts of wildland fires will continue to increase in importance.  \nTo shine a spotlight on current research trends on this important topic in collaboration with ACS ES&T Air, we have curated this collection of recently published papers back through 2019 in ES&T, ES&T Letters, and ACS ES&T Water related to wildland fire research.  This collection showcases some of the breadth and complexity of wildland fire research, covering wildland fire emissions, impacts on the wildland/urban interface, brown carbon production, the atmospheric evolution of wildland fire smoke, source apportionment studies, impacts on human health and ecosystems, and advances in smoke modelling.  \nWe hope you enjoy this curated collection and that it helps inform and inspire future research in this important area of air chemistry and environmental research.  \n\nAmara Holder (US EPA) and Amy Sullivan (Colorado State University)",

It is a concept and strategy that has developed over the past 15 years as scientists identify threats that could imperil Earth systems and society as we know it today, and how to address them sustainably.  Nine Planetary Boundaries have been considered:  Climate change, ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone, biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and phosphorus cycle, global freshwater use, land system change, biodiversity loss, novel entities (formerly chemical pollution) and atmospheric aerosol loading.   Transgressing one or more of these Planetary Boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change.   \n    <br><br>\n    More recently, the Earth Commission further developed the concept into a set of Safe and Just Earth System Boundaries (ESBs), defining limits not only for maintaining a stable and resilient Earth system (i.e. safe boundaries), but also to minimize harm to humans (i.e. just boundaries). The new ESBs are intended to provide the world with a viable corridor to transition to sustainable practices.  Currently, the Safe and Just ESBs have been quantified for climate, the biosphere, fresh water, nutrients, and aerosols at global and sub-global scales.  \n    <br><br>\n    Currently, the <a href=\"https://earthcommission.org/news/new-cohort-of-experts/\">Earth Commission 2.0</a> is working on redefining the Safe and Just ESBs of those already set by considering interactions between boundaries and inevitable trade-offs that will be needed, to translate the Safe and Just ESBs into actionable targets, and to chart transformation pathways so that societies can pull back from exceeding the boundaries. Earth Commission 2.0 is also tackling the difficult question of setting Safe and Just ESBs for novel entities. Because boundaries alone are insufficient to bring about change, Earth Commission 2.0 is also tasked with developing the transformative pathways for societies to stay within the boundaries for novel entities.\n    <br><br>\n    To support this effort and shine a spotlight on recent research on the Planetary Boundaries, particularly in the chemical pollution or ‘novel entity’ space, we have curated this Collection of recently published papers from <cite>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</cite> and <cite>Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters</cite> entitled ‘Transgressing Earth System Boundaries’.

The advanced algorithms and modeling approaches grouped under this \"AI\" umbrella empower us to use data to build predictive models for complex phenomena and apply these models in generative contexts to make suggestions or recommendations. Simultaneously, social scientists are grasping the ethical, legal, and societal implications of this exponential growth of AI in various aspects of our lives. As Associate Editors of Macromolecules and active researchers in AI and machine learning (ML) for polymer science, it is clear to us that the field of polymer science is lagging behind most other areas of chemistry in adopting and applying AI tools. Specifically, the fields of inorganic chemistry, nanomaterials, biomedical imaging, and bioinformatics are farther ahead in leveraging the power of AI and ML. We believe this may be because our field presents many unique challenges that prevent the AI tools developed in other areas of chemistry from being directly translated to polymer science, some of which we address in this Collection.",

Biopolymers have taken an important role in the design of bio-based materials with functional properties, especially those derived from biomass available at a large scale. Recent studies have shown how proteins have taken a new dimension in developing functional materials, taking a step forward from their traditional use in food and biomedicine. By correlating the amino acidic profile of proteins at the nanoscale with their thermomechanical properties at the macroscale enables us to translate these precision polymers into a versatile design of materials, targeting large-scale applications such as foams and food packaging. Moreover, the advances in understanding proteins from a bottom-up perspective reached promising achievements for their use in applications that were not foreseen before, including biosensors, optoelectronics and semiconductors.",

The articles are organized along a progression of ideas related to conducting Chemical Education Research (CER), an area of scholarship the Prof. Bunce championed throughout her career. The first section addresses ways new investigators can get started doing CER work. The second section considers CER studies in settings with relatively small class sizes and the third section collects articles that describe CER projects carried out in large classroom settings where statistical treatments of quantitative data are appropriate. In addition to articles about studies from her own research group, her contributions to the <cite>Journal of Chemical Education</cite> include serving as the first Associate Editor for manuscripts describing CER studies.

Treagust of Curtin University. Five different areas of student learning of chemistry inform the themes incorporated in this collection. They include (1) student understanding of chemical equilibrium; (2) laboratory learning and the influence of on-line technologies; (3) the role of multiple representations in student learning about chemicals; (4) the challenges students have learning about chemical bonding; and (5) the development and use of diagnostic testing instruments to inform the teaching of chemistry. Prof. Treagust has been an international leader in scholarship related to these themes, as well as others. The Journal is happy to have the ability to honor Prof. Treagust for his contributions to the field, and his contributions to the Journal.",

Firstly, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Har Gobind Khorana (1922-2011) whose pioneering work on the genetic code and its deciphering laid the foundation for the development of modern biotechnology and genetic engineering. Har Gobind Khorana shared the 1968 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Marshall W. Nirenberg and Robert W. Holley for his research on the genetic code and its interpretation by cells. In subsequent years, he developed his understanding even further by synthesizing RNA fragments of a known sequence and determining the corresponding amino acid sequence of the protein they encoded. His work was founded on the publication 70 years ago of the double-helical structure of Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid by James Watson and Francis Crick. This discovery, along with the key contribution by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, is widely regarded as one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century. The articles presented in this virtual special issue serve as representative samples, albeit not exhaustive, of how the synthesis and structure of DNA have profoundly influenced areas further afield.",

Laboratory and computational studies of the structures, spectroscopy, unimolecular isomerization and photodissociation pathways, and bimolecular chemical reactions of these sCIs are the subject of this Collection. Trends apparent in these publications include extension of the experimental and computational investigations to larger, structurally more complex sCIs than formaldehyde oxide and acetaldehyde oxide, and study of Criegee intermediate chemistry occurring in water and at the air-water interface. All these contributions are significantly advancing our understanding of the production and fates of sCIs in the Earth’s troposphere, whether by chemical reaction, uptake at water interfaces, or solar photolysis.",

The most prominent example is photosynthesis: Solar photons are absorbed by plants, which store their energy in the form of chemical bonds. Plants then use this stored solar energy to grow, creating food as well as feedstocks that can themselves be used as energy sources (e.g., wood, coal, petrol, and general fossil fuels). It is the intensive use of fossil fuels (accumulated solar energy saved over thousands of years) that is leading to a rocketing increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and to global warming. A rapid and decisive transition towards clean and sustainable energy sources is urgently needed to revert this trend. Photonic sciences, dealing with the manipulation of photons – the most fundamental energy carrier – have already played a crucial role in such energy transition; and are increasingly doing so. This is the focus of this virtual special issue.",

Given their prevalence in cellular machinery, many of these processes have significant implications not only in various aspects of biophysics but also in the rational design of drugs. Consequently, it is highly desirable to predict their feasibility using theoretical tools. In recent decades, substantial strides have been made in determining free energies through the application of numerical simulations grounded in the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics. While the accessibility of computational resources, in particular the rapid development of fast and affordable graphics processing units, has contributed to these advancements, the primary catalyst for progress lies in the development of a diverse array of methods. These methods have effectively enhanced the efficiency and reliability of calculations related to free energy, opening new perspectives for the computational study of a variety of complex problems hitherto intractable. For this Collection, we have assembled 22 papers recently published in <cite>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</cite> and <cite>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B</cite> that serve as excellent examples of insight gained from free energy calculations.",

The papers included have investigated how human exposure is occurring via ingestion, inhalation, and medicinal routes. Articles include how ingestion of nano- and microplastic fragments in drinking water may affect fetal growth and development in humans (Aghaei et al., 2022), how the impact of exposure to environmentally relevant doses of microplastics may affect male reproductivity in terrestrial mammals with transgenerational effects on their offspring (Deng et al., 2022), how the environmental weathering of plastics may alter the adsorption behavior of nanoplastics in the blood stream to plasma proteins (Wen et al., 2022), the human inhalation exposure to microplastics via human inhaled indoor aerosol (HIA) and human exhaled breath (HEB) (Geng et al, 2023), the assessment of potential links between gestational exposure to selected plasticizers and antioxidants and placental functions in a population-based study (Jing et al., 2023), examining the dietary exposure of small infants to the complex cocktail of plastic additives present in baby food packaging (Tan et al., 2023), and assessing the exposure potential for microplastics to directly enter the bloodstream of humans via infusion therapy from the infusion-material containers (e.g., glass infusion bottles, plastic infusion bottles, plastic infusion bags, plastic infusion tubes) (Zhu et al., 2023). <br><br> The exposure of aquatic and terrestrial species to nano- and microplastics in the environment and potential adverse impacts is also included in this collection. Investigations include understanding the tissue-specific bioaccumulation of nano- and microplastics in the gills and ovaries of medaka Oryzias melastigma using stable carbon isotopes (Yeo et al., 2023), the responses of aquatic plants following exposure to microplastics in sediments and adverse impacts on the ecological assembly processes of the rhizosphere microbial community (Lin et al., 2023), and the assessment of nano- and microplastics in soil and impacts on plant functions (Azeem et al., 2022). <br><br> Additional papers in this collection examine potential solutions to reduce environmental plastic contamination and resulting exposure pathways. Schwartz-Narbonne et al. (2022) observe that significant levels of microplastics concentrate in wastewater treatment plants from human excretion pathways, despite sophisticated treatment procedures. Plastic fragments are deposited into settled solids, which are frequently used to enrich soils, affecting soil communities, plant health, and increased environmental dispersal via hydrologic and aeolian processes. The authors call for an upgrading of wastewater treatment approaches to tertiary level and the exclusion of floating or primary settled solids from land-applied biosolids. Wang et al. (2022) call for greater transparency in the chemicals used for plastics production to lessen the complexity in the environmental burden and consequently reduce risk to public health and ecosystems. <br><br> We hope you enjoy this curated collection of papers showcasing the latest developments in understanding exposure pathways and health impact assessments of nano- and microplastics in the environment, for the protection of our health and our environment.",

Early in his career, he became a leader in time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy, with successes in measuring transient Raman spectra of prototypical short-lived transient species. Subsequent projects included advances in picosecond time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond time-resolved UV-visible, near- and mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy, picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy, infrared electroabsorption spectroscopy, and hyper-Raman spectroscopy. He adeptly applied these techniques to study various photochemical phenomena such as photoisomerization, excited-state proton transfer, and charge transfer processes. One of the highlights was finding intermolecular vibronic coupling induced by solvent vibration, which was beautifully demonstrated through resonance hyper-Raman spectroscopy of beta-carotene. Expanding into new research areas, he began studies of ionic liquids and living cells. In the latter area, he used confocal Raman microscopy to track the cell division process in fission yeast and showed the importance of label-free live cell imaging at a very early time. In addition, he broadened the horizons of cancer diagnostics using near-infrared-excited Raman spectroscopy on surgical samples and minimizing autofluorescence in the resulting spectra. The 87 papers by Prof. Hamaguchi's friends and colleagues collected for this issue celebrate the remarkable legacy of his life's work.",

It has become a new type of pollution, although invisible, in our modern society. To effectively reduce EMI in space or better, completely block electromagnetic fields, the development of EMI-shielding materials with high absorption capacity is critical. In this collection curated by our associate editor Dr. Dongling Ma, we showcase some of the high-quality original research papers or reviews published in <cite>ACS Applied Nano Materials</cite> on this trending topic.",

Different strategies encompassing both classical and contemporary approaches have enabled access to new structures of value. <br><br> The more recent, diverse inventions of synthetic methodology as a field unto itself, and also the advent of catalytic chemistries and new reagents, made the time right for explosive growth in late-stage functionalization. Stereo-, regio-, chemo- and site-selectivity challenges all accumulate when considering derivatization of structurally and functionally complex molecular core structures. The result has been powerful and exciting literature under the banners of scaffold diversification, remodeling, editing, and, of course, late-stage functionalization itself.

Control of molecular quantum states has improved dramatically thanks to advances in producing cold molecular beams and trapped gas samples. Manipulation of individual molecules in optical tweezers and of many-body interactions in various optical lattice configurations have opened exciting possibilities. Likewise, control of quantum states has been achieved or proposed in a variety of materials, from defects in bulk materials to thin films and quantum dots and even large molecules such as dyes and fullerenes. The breadth of quantum technologies to which these molecular and materials platforms have the potential to cater is vast, including areas of sensing, computing, quantum optics, and beyond. In this VSI, we explore quantum information science where molecular systems take center stage.",

                "long_blurb": "Rechargeable batteries are essential for establishing a sustainable, carbon-neutral society based on renewable energies. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from transport, which account for around 20% of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, can be reduced by increasing the number of electric vehicles operated by rechargeable batteries, and the large-scale introduction of renewable energy, which fluctuates with time, requires rechargeable batteries to stabilize the energy supply. Lithium-ion batteries are most widely used for these applications, but their energy and power densities need to be improved, and their cost is too high. Thus, the development of innovative next-generation rechargeable batteries is required. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) started the first large-scale project on next-generation batteries, the Advanced Low Carbon Research Program (ALCA) - Specially Promoted Research for Innovative Next Generation Batteries (SPRING) in 2013. It was designed to promote research in a top-down approach by teams to realize practical batteries, including all-solid-state, lithium-sulfur, lithium-air, and magnesium batteries. The hope is that this VSI will accelerate the research and development of innovative next-generation batteries worldwide through international collaborations.",
